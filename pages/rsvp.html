        <p>To keep things simple, we'll be asking for RSVPs directly via the formal invitation.</p>
        <p>Our RSVP will contain the usual. Since Amy has expressed a strong preference for availability of vegan food, there will be plenty. However, please let us know if you have additional dietary restrictions or food allergies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Number attending (adults & children)</li>
          <li>Contact email/address</li>
          <li>Dietary preferences</li>

          <h4 class="content-subtitle">What's the plan with COVID?</h4>
          <p>We want you to stay safe and healthy, so we are postponing for a year from the original date.  The new date is Saturday August 28, 2021.  Looking forward to having an even better shindig!</p>
          <p>COVID update (Aug 13) We are still proceeding with the event! While Delta variant cases are not looking great numbers-wise, vaccinated people are showing strong resilience to it. That said, we are taking precautions to make sure everyone is as safe as possible.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Masks will be provided for everyone, vaccinated or not (please wear them near others, especially indoors)</li>
            <li>If you are vaccinated, thank you for doing your part to keep everyone safe</li>
            <li>If you are unvaccinated, please get tested 2-3 days beforehand</li>
            <li>If you are feeling sick the day of the wedding, please do not come :)</li>
            <li>We are adding the venue's outdoor sun deck for additional reception space. We will also keep the main reception space as ventilated as possible by opening the windows.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h4 class="content-subtitle">Is there a dress code?</h4>
          <p>Cocktail attire (nice, but not super formal). The Seattle area generally has sunny, mild weather in the Summer but there can be unpredictable heat waves. As the wedding will be in the mountains, it should be on the cooler end.</p>
          <p>Additionally, make sure to bring a pair of shoes suitable for walking on the dirt or small rocks that will likely be at the top of the gondola. Sun protection, whether a hat and sunglasses or sunscreen (or both!) is probably also a good idea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h4 class="content-subtitle">Will you have a registry?</h4>
          <p>We haven't decided yet. What we want more than anything else is for you to attend and have a good time. If we decide to have one, a registry link will be provided once formal invitations have been sent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h4 class="content-subtitle">Are kids welcome?</h4>
          <p>Of course! Our young nieces and nephew will most likely be attending, so feel free to bring your kids. Be sure to supervise them, since mountain terrain can have steep falls.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
          <h4 class="content-subtitle">How is parking?</h4>
          <p>Super plentiful. The ski resort accommodates thousands of visitors every weekend during the Winter, and is much less crowded during the summer. A trail running event (Ragnar) will be occuring the same weekend, but attendees are restricted to their own area of the parking lots.</p>
